Project 2: Interactive Full-Stack Application 

## TEAM BUILDER 

To build a fullstack web portal where data resides on the available team players to chose from so a coach can create the ultimate team.

## User Story

As a High School Basketball team coach, we have finished our local area and will be on to the State final playoffs.  As a coach, I must chose a team from the 5 local High School's player listing.  With this data I will be able to build the ultimate team to take to the playoffs.  To simply the measures, I will need to have each players stats turned into a rating system of 1-5, 5 being the highest rating.  To build my team I will need the best from each of the 5 team positions and the difficulty may lie in the fact that several players may fulfill a few different positions.  Therefore, I would like the choices brought to me in a way that each player will show up with their best position/ratings.

After chosing my draft, I would like to be presented with the ultimate team of 15 players, covering each position: I will need (3) Point Guards, (2) Small Forwards, (2) Power Forwards, (5) Shoot Guards and (3) Centers.

## Motivation to create this project

As Full-Stack Developer's, we chose this project to assist with the database needed to create this web portal for the coach.  One of our team members happens to be a High School Basketball coach who was explaining his job details and we all concluded this would be good project to see how a server-side database could be useful.

## Problem(s) Solved

With 'Team Builder,' we aim to revolutionize the scouting process for high-school basketball coaches, providing them with real-time player statistics, intuitive evaluation tools, and a secure platform to assemble winning teams. Our motivation stems from a deep desire to empower coaches with the means to elevate their coaching strategies and lead their teams to success. 'Team Builder' was born from the conviction that data-driven decision-making and a user-friendly experience can make a significant impact on high-school basketball teams, fostering growth, camaraderie, and competitive excellence.


## Learning Curves

Trying to get routing to properly connect and setting up the entire mapped out idea within MVC. Heroku deployment had issues and we had to change all file folder names from using uppercase to lowercase to solve the issue Ie. Models to mdls and Public to pblic, etc., this caused major issues as codes already written in routes all had to be found and changed as well.  Total nightmare!



## Steps required to install project

1. Clone the Repository from GitHub 
(or) Download Zip Folder from Repository from GitHub
Open the cloned (or downloaded) repository in any source code editor.
2. Deploy in Heroku via github.

## Usage Instructions

1. Make an account if you already have an account sign in and proceed. if not click on "Sign Up" button and proceed with the "Sign Up" option
