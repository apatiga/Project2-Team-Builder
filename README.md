Project 2: Interactive Full-Stack Application 

## TEAM BUILDER 
To build a fullstack web portal where data resides on the available team players to chose from so a coach can create the ultimate team.

## User Story:
As a High School Basketball team coach, we have finished our local area and will be on to the State final playoffs.  As a coach, I must chose a team from the 5 local High School's player listing.  With this data I will be able to build the ultimate team to take to the playoffs.  To simply the measures, I will need to have each players stats turned into a rating system of 1-5, 5 being the highest rating.  To build my team I will need the best from each of the 5 team positions and the difficulty may lie in the fact that several players may fulfill a few different positions.  Therefore, I would like the choices brought to me in a way that each player will show up with their best position/ratings.

After chosing my draft, I would like to be presented with the ultimate team of 15 players, covering each position: I will need (3) Point Guards, (2) Small Forwards, (2) Power Forwards, (5) Shoot Guards and (3) Centers.

## Motivation to create this project:
As Full-Stack Developer's, we chose this project to assist with the database needed to create this web portal for the coach.  One of our team members happens to be a High School Basketball coach who was explaining his job details and we all concluded this would be good project to see how a server-side database could be useful.
